# Jramma's Portfolio üöÄ

This is my first Astro website, and I'm still fixing bugs. Any help is welcome.

The Swiper dependency is used in GaleriaSlider.astro, which I'm refining, but it still has errors.

## Structure üå≥

The 'public' folder contains all the images. Ideally, all the data would come from a database, which will be implemented in the next update using AstroDB.

PS: The images are not free to use. This is the only aspect of the project that you can't copy.

```
/src
	/assets
		global.css
	/components
		/foto
			All .astro files of photography path
		/home
			Title.astro
		/projects
			All .astro files of projects path
	Card.astro (default Astro card)
	Enllac.astro: personal link
	Theme.astro: dark mode
	TornarInici.astro: menu for returning home
/data
	All .json files with data
/icons
	.svg files
/pages
	Works with Astro logic. I used .md files as in the Astro tutorial (refer to Astro docs)
```
